This is my solution to the Instafilter project (project 13) in the [100 Days Of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) tutorial created by Paul Hudson ([@twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws)). This was an introduction to Core Image and gave us a taste of what's possible with this very powerful (but very old) API. The project led us through the creation of useful SwiftUI-friendly objects that wrap image picking and saving.
